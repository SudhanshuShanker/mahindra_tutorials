optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --version             show program's version number and exit

                        and UPPER case for helix
  -p PARTITION, --partition PARTITION
                        partition for starting from a mixture of helix/coil

**We have also provided a tester file that checks commands required for basic docking**  
Download the the tester.sh file from this directory and run is using this command in activated adcpsuite environment:  
```sh
(adcpsuite) USERNAME@SYSTEM:~$ chmod +x tester.sh
(adcpsuite) USERNAME@SYSTEM:~$ ./tester.sh
```
This command may take a few minutes to complete. After completion, it will generate a log file that can be analyzed to find errors.  
  
```sh
cat test_ADCP\log.out
```
